## General

### Known bugs

- Players may need to relog (just once) when first joining a new guild for communications to work properly.  If they don't do this, achievements might not be registered, until they relog for the first time.

### Weekly Reset

- Scores have a `This Week` field.  `This Week` resets every Thursday at 3AM PST.

## Instructions for Officers

### Setting Streamer Names

Setting streamer names will enable leaderboards.  Streamer names don't need to be set immediately.  To set a streamer name, edit the public note area for a character and `~<CHARACTER_NAME>~` to it. For example, if `Yaz` is the streamer name, set the public notes to `~Yaz~`.  You can add other notes after that string.


### Adjusting points

As an officer, hit the minimap button, then go to points -> officer commands.  There you should a drop down and a couple edit boxes.  Select the race, character (optional), and number of points.  To the right there should be a preview of the modification.  Hit submit when ready
